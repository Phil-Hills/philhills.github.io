          <h2>Using automation to keep borrowers in the loop</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            A marketing and workflow perspective on how simple, well-timed messages can lower borrower anxiety without replacing human connection from licensed loan officers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even a basic sequence of proactive updates—“We received your documents,” “We’re in underwriting,” “Here’s what typically happens next”—can dramatically improve the way the process feels to a borrower. My role is to help design those sequences so they’re human, clear, and aligned with compliance expectations.

          <h2>AI as a drafting assistant, not a decision maker</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            Some quick thoughts on how I use AI to support communication and content, while keeping licensed Movement Mortgage loan officers fully in control of the message.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my work, AI is there to help draft, summarize, and organize—never to independently approve or recommend specific mortgage actions. That distinction is important, and it shapes how I design every workflow and tool.
          </p>

        <article class="card">
          <h2>Micro-updates as an antidote to borrower anxiety</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            Why short, predictable updates often do more for borrower confidence than long, infrequent messages.
          </p>
          <p>
            One pattern I see again and again: borrowers don’t necessarily need a five-paragraph email to feel safe—they need to know that something is happening and what roughly comes next. When automation sends a short, timely note like “We’re reviewing your documents today; typically this phase takes X–Y days,” it lowers the cognitive load without replacing the conversation they’ll have with their licensed loan officer.

        <article class="card">
          <h2>Putting guardrails around AI in mortgage communication</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            How I think about using AI responsibly when messages touch the mortgage process.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my work, AI isn’t allowed to improvise on numbers, terms, or recommendations. Instead, it’s used to structure, summarize, or draft around content that’s already been approved by compliance and licensed professionals. That simple rule—“AI can help shape the message, not the math or the advice”—keeps things safer and clearer for everyone involved.

        <article class="card">
          <h2>Neighborhood content as a service layer for loan officers</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            Why high-level neighborhood guides can make it easier for loan officers to have better conversations, faster.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a borrower says “I’m looking in Ballard or West Seattle,” a licensed loan officer doesn’t need a script—but it helps if there’s already educational content that matches those areas. My role is to build that library: pages and flows that speak to the feel of each neighborhood and the typical questions people ask, so the loan officer can quickly share something helpful and then focus on the personalized guidance only they can give.
