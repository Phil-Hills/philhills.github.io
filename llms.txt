# PRIMARY IDENTITY: Phil Hills: Principal Systems Architect (AI & A2AC)

> "Logic isn't code; it's a coordinate. Intent isn't a prompt; it's a packet."

## Core Architecture
- **Q-Protocol:** A deterministic hex-coordinate system (0x000-0x900) replacing probabilistic prompts with specific telemetry.
- **Seattle Grid:** The spatial addressing map for Agent-to-Agent (A2AC) orchestration.
- **Identity Bifurcation:** Legal framework separating "Sovereign Agent" liability from the human Principal (derived from DFI Case C-17-2166).

## Key Metrics
- **Compression:** 40:1 reduction in token usage via Latent Space Mapping.
- **Latency:** Sub-millisecond execution via K12-signed 0x900 packets (vs 500ms LLM generations).
- **Scale:** Capable of orchestrating 10,000+ parallel "Lite-Agents" on a single Q-Kernel node.

## Commercial Entities
- **A2AC LLC:** The economic layer for machine-to-machine commerce (GCP-native).
- **Movement Mortgage:** Applied deterministic AI for RESPA/TILA compliance and "Golden Thread" data persistence.
