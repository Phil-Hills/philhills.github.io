        A behind-the-scenes look at how I use automation and AI to support licensed Movement Mortgage loan officers and create smoother borrower experiences—without ever stepping into the role of a loan originator.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page-section">
      <div class="stack">
        <div>
          <h2>Workflow design, not loan decisions</h2>
          <p>
            My work centers on process design and communication. I map out the steps borrowers and partners go through with licensed loan officers, then use automation and AI to make those steps more organized, timely, and clear.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Examples of support-focused automation</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Automated outreach that reminds borrowers what documents they may need to prepare, in plain language</li>
            <li>Notifications that help loan officers stay on top of key milestones with each file</li>
            <li>Agent touchpoint prompts so partners aren’t left guessing about status updates</li>
            <li>Educational message templates that explain the process in a simple, friendly way</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted">
            All of these tools are built to keep licensed professionals at the center of decisions, while letting automation handle repetitive communication needs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>AI within safe boundaries</h2>
          <p>
            AI can be incredibly helpful in summarizing, drafting, and organizing communication. I use it to support clarity and efficiency, always with guardrails to make sure licensed professionals remain responsible for actual mortgage guidance.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Conversation design for borrower FAQs (non-specific, educational in nature)</li>
            <li>Drafting copy that loan officers can review, personalize, and approve</li>
            <li>Internal-only tools to organize and prioritize workload</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Why this matters for borrowers</h2>
          <p>
            Borrowers often juggle big life decisions while navigating the mortgage process. Better workflows and clearer communication help reduce anxiety, set expectations, and keep everyone on the same page—all while licensed Movement Mortgage loan officers remain the direct point of contact for specific mortgage questions.
