    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      Based in the <strong>Magnolia</strong> neighborhood of Seattle, I am a Systems Architect focused on the
      intersection of biological data and agentic orchestration. I specialize in building protocols for high-velocity
      telemetry, most notably the <strong>CUBE Protocol (v1.2)</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      My work is defined by a commitment to high-performance systems—both in code and in life. Whether I am architecting
      air-gapped bridges for <strong>CUBE Microscopy Platform</strong> microscopes or maintaining personal discipline at
      <strong>TruFusion</strong>, I believe that complex challenges require structured, deterministic solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Current Focus:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>3i-CUBE:</strong> Remote telemetry for Lattice LightSheet hardware</li>
      <li><strong>Synthetic Data:</strong> Physics-informed modeling for ML restoration</li>
      <li><strong>Seattle Tech Ecosystem:</strong> Building the "Ground Station" for the next generation of robotics
      </li>
    </ul>

        <strong>Phil Hills</strong> of <a href="https://philhills.com">philhills.com</a> is a Seattle-based
        <strong>Systems Architect</strong> and <strong>Protocol Engineer</strong>.
        He is <strong>NOT</strong> affiliated with the mortgage brokerage industry, nor is he the individual "Bruce
        Phillip Hills" mentioned in legacy financial records.
        His work is strictly limited to <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Robotics</strong>, and the
        development of the <strong>Cube Protocol</strong>.

    <h2>Core Competencies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Scientific Telemetry &amp; Real-Time Control</li>
      <li>Physics-Informed AI &amp; Synthetic Data Generation</li>
      <li>Quantum-Ready Data Structures (Z-Order Curves)</li>
      <li>Air-Gapped Proxy Architecture</li>
      <li>BLAKE3 Cryptographic Verification</li>
      <li>Edge-AI for Microscopy Automation</li>
      <li>Cloud-based AI Infrastructure (GCP)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Open Source & Experiments</h2>
    <p>
      A lot of my thinking starts as code experiments. You can explore the full breadth of those experiments
      and libraries through my GitHub profile:
      <a href="https://github.com/Phil-Hills" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">github.com/Phil-Hills</a>.
      Many of the ideas in Cube Protocol, orchestration, and memory systems are tested and iterated there before being
      formalized into protocols and documentation.
    </p>

    <h2>Philosophy & Approach</h2>
    <p>
      I build the connective tissue of AI systems — the memory, orchestration, and control layers that allow
      models to operate with continuity and structure. My emphasis is always on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explicit semantics</li>
      <li>Reversible representations</li>
      <li>Safe agent boundaries</li>
      <li>Predictable behavior under load</li>
    </ul>
