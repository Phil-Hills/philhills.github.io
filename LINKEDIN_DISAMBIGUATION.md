## Sample LinkedIn Post (After Profile Update)

```
🚀 Excited to share a technical deep-dive on the 3i-CUBE Telemetry Bridge

After months of architecting air-gapped control systems for Lattice LightSheet microscopy, I've documented the full system architecture using Mermaid.js.

The challenge: Remote control of $500k hardware generating 4TB of data at 2,000 fps.

The solution: CUBE Protocol v1.2 with 42M:1 compression + Physics-Informed AI for low-photon restoration.

Check out the technical showcase: https://philhills.com/3i-cube-architecture.html
