        <h1>Career Story of Bruce Phillip Hills (Professional Edition)</h1>
    </header>    <main><p>The career story of Bruce Phillip Hills, professionally known today as Phil Hills, is one defined by curiosity, reinvention, and the pursuit of intelligent automation.</p><p>Phil’s path started in operational and administrative environments, where manual effort, repetitive workflows, and fragmented systems were the norm. Over time, he became obsessed with building better systems — systems that could reason, decide, and act.</p><p>This led to a deep focus on AI, machine learning, and automation frameworks. As his engineering work evolved, he transitioned to his preferred public and professional identity: Phil Hills.</p><p>Today, Phil designs and builds intelligent systems that move the world toward more efficient, AI-first operations.</p>    </main>    <footer>
