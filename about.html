          <h2>My role in the mortgage world</h2>
          <p>
            I work behind the scenes of the mortgage process, focused on marketing, automation, and digital experience design. My contribution is to help licensed Movement Mortgage loan officers stay connected with borrowers and partners through thoughtful systems and messaging.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do not originate loans or offer mortgage advice. Instead, I focus on building tools and communication frameworks that make it easier for licensed professionals to do their jobs and for borrowers to feel informed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Background in fintech and automation</h2>
          <p>
            For more than two decades, I’ve worked with technology, automation, and conversational systems. That experience translates into practical improvements for the lending process—things like smarter follow-up workflows, AI-assisted communication, and borrower-friendly educational content.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>How I support Movement Mortgage loan officers</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Designing marketing journeys and content libraries</li>
            <li>Creating automation that supports outreach and follow-up</li>
            <li>Helping translate complex mortgage steps into simple, human language</li>
            <li>Building frameworks for neighborhood-based, Seattle-focused education</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>What I don’t do</h2>
          <p>
            To be clear and compliant:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>I am not a mortgage loan originator.</li>
            <li>I do not quote interest rates, terms, or payments.</li>
            <li>I do not take mortgage applications.</li>
            <li>I do not provide individualized mortgage advice.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted">
            All mortgage-related guidance, quotes, and decisions are handled exclusively by licensed Movement Mortgage loan officers.
          </p>
