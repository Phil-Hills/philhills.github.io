      "Hey, I’m Phil Hills. I’m an AI programmer and automation architect based in Seattle, Washington.",
      "My work centers around building intelligent systems — tools that can think, reason, and act to reduce friction in the way people and businesses operate.",
      "I specialize in machine learning engineering, multi-agent automation, and the design of AI-first workflows. For the past several years, I’ve been developing systems that classify information, make decisions, and coordinate actions across complex processes.",
      "One of the core projects I’m building is called Cube Protocol. It’s a multi-agent framework that lets AI systems collaborate, delegate tasks, and execute workflows with a level of structure and intelligence that traditional automation systems can’t match.",
      "My philosophy is simple: AI should make life easier. It should amplify human ability, create clarity, and eliminate unnecessary work. That belief guides every tool and system I build.",
      "If you’re interested in AI engineering, intelligent automation, or the future of AI-driven workflows, you can follow my work at PhilHills.com or on GitHub.",
      "Thanks for watching — more to come soon."
