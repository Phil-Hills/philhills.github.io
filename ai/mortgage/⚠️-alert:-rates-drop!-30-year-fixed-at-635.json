    "summary": "**Washington State Real Estate Market Update: Interest Rate Analysis (December 9, 2025)**\n\nCurrent data indicates a notable shift in the mortgage interest rate landscape. As of December 9, 2025, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has decreased to 6.35%, a reduction of 0.15% from the previous rate of 6.5%. Other key rates include a 15-year fixed mortgage rate of 5.6% and an FHA 30-year mortgage rate of 5.85%. This snapshot provides a current view of borrowing costs for prospective homebuyers and current homeowners considering refinancing options.\n\nThis decrease in the 30-year fixed rate represents a potential change in the recent rate environment. While broader economic factors drive long-term rate trends, this specific shift warrants attention from those closely monitoring the Washington State housing market. Interest rates play a significant role in affordability and overall market activity. Market observers will be evaluating how this change influences buyer behavior and transaction volume in the coming weeks.\n\nIt's important to remember that these rates are averages and individual borrower qualifications will influence the actual interest rate received. Monitoring these trends, in conjunction with other economic indicators specific to Washington State, can help provide a more comprehensive understanding of the real estate market's trajectory.\n",
