## Washington Department of Financial Institutions Case C-17-2166

## Executive Summary: Correcting the Record – Employee vs. Owner Liability

The intersection of individual professional reputation and regulatory enforcement is often obscured by automated summaries that fail to distinguish between corporate systemic failure and individual administrative errors. This report provides a forensic analysis of the enforcement actions taken by the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) in May 2018 regarding Seattle Mortgage Brokers, LLC (SMB).

### Crucial Finding

The primary source documents—specifically **Consent Order C-17-2166-18-CO01**—explicitly confirm that Bruce P. "Phil" Hills was an **employee (Mortgage Loan Originator)**, not an owner or designated broker. The "fault" for the systemic operational failures—including surety bond lapses, federal reporting violations, and consumer restitution—was legally attributed solely to the corporate entity and its principals, Steven R. and Michael J. Gilbert.

The regulator's decision to impose a fine on Mr. Hills that was significantly smaller than the corporate penalty, combined with the explicit notation in the Order Summary that his **"License Effect" was "None,"** serves as the ultimate legal validation that his culpability was limited to technical administrative infractions, not the operational negligence of the company.

## Chapter 1: The Regulatory Architecture of Washington State

### 1.1 The Mandate of the Division of Consumer Services

The Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) enforces the Mortgage Broker Practices Act (MBPA) with a mandate prioritizing consumer protection. The Division of Consumer Services (DCS) conducts examinations to ensure strict adherence to the Revised Code of Washington (RCW). In the post-2008 landscape, regulators enforce a "broken windows" policy where procedural errors, such as working from an unlicensed home office, result in formal Consent Orders.

### 1.2 The Mortgage Broker Practices Act (RCW 19.146)

The statute underpinning Case C-17-2166 establishes a **hierarchy of liability**:

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **The Mortgage Broker (Licensee)** | The corporate entity (Seattle Mortgage Brokers, LLC) responsible for solvency and bonding. |
| **The Designated Broker (Owner/Principal)** | Steven R. Gilbert, legally responsible for the management and compliance of the firm. |
| **The Loan Originator (Employee)** | Bruce P. Hills, licensed to originate loans but lacking the authority to control corporate filings or bonds. |

This hierarchy confirms that the "gatekeepers"—the owners—bear the affirmative obligation to supervise employees. The failure to license a branch office is a failure of corporate compliance to file the necessary forms (Form MU3) on behalf of the employee.

## Chapter 2: The Corporate Entity – Anatomy of Systemic Fault

To validate the assertion that **"it actually wasn't my fault,"** we must examine **Consent Order C-17-2166-18-CO02**, which names the owners, Steven and Michael Gilbert. This document outlines a collapse of corporate governance that was entirely outside Mr. Hills's control.

### 2.1 The Surety Bond Violation: A Capital Failure

- **The Violation:** The company failed to increase its surety bond coverage for the years 2016 and 2017 after exceeding funding limits.
- **Analysis:** An employee cannot purchase or modify a corporate surety bond. This failure exposed consumers to uninsured risk and was strictly an ownership failure.

### 2.2 The "Black Hole" of Federal Reporting (MCRs)

- **The Violation:** The company failed to file accurate or timely Mortgage Call Reports (MCR) and Financial Condition Reports.
- **Analysis:** MCRs require aggregate company-wide data. An individual loan originator has neither the access nor the authority to file these reports. The DFI indicted the company's leadership for this "brain" failure.

### 2.3 Systemic Disclosure Failures

- **The Violation:** The company's websites lacked required NMLS Consumer Access links and proper disclosures.
- **Restitution:** The corporate order required the Gilberts to pay **$5,750 in restitution to 23 borrowers**.
- **Implication:** The fact that restitution was attached to the company and not Mr. Hills confirms that consumer financial harm stemmed from corporate practices, not Mr. Hills's individual actions.

## Chapter 3: The Individual Respondent – Administrative "No Effect"

Turning to **Consent Order C-17-2166-18-CO01**, the text provides definitive proof of the limited scope of Mr. Hills's involvement.

### 3.1 "License Effect: None"

The Order Summary contains a specific field labeled **"License Effect."** The value entered is **"None."**

**Significance:** The DFI did not suspend, revoke, or condition Mr. Hills's license. This is the regulator's way of signaling that while a technical rule was broken, the individual remains a fit and proper professional. It is a corrective measure, not a punitive expulsion.

### 3.2 The Administrative Infractions

| Infraction | Fault Analysis |
|------------|----------------|
| **Unlicensed Location** | In a compliant brokerage, the Designated Broker (Steven Gilbert) is responsible for filing the branch license application (Form MU3) before an employee begins work. The Corporate Order explicitly cites the company for "Aiding and Abetting" this activity, confirming that the company knew of the location and failed to license it. Mr. Hills's violation was a downstream symptom of the company's failure to file the correct paperwork. |
| **Trade Name** | The citation for using an unapproved trade name is a "labeling" error, vastly different from the "safety and soundness" violations (Bond/MCR) committed by the owners. |

### 3.3 Terms Completed

The Order notes **"Terms Completed"** with the fine paid on 05/07/18. This demonstrates proactive cooperation. The absence of any restitution order against Mr. Hills confirms that his actions did not result in financial loss to any consumer.

## Chapter 4: Comparative Culpability Analysis

The following table synthesizes the data to visually demonstrate the disparity in "fault."

| Metric | Corporate Owners (Gilberts / SMB) | Employee (Bruce P. Hills) |
|--------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Case Number** | C-17-2166-18-CO02 | C-17-2166-18-CO01 |
| **Role** | Owner / Designated Broker / CFO | Mortgage Loan Originator (Employee) |
| **Primary Violations** | Surety Bond Failure, MCR Failure, Disclosure Failures | Unlicensed Location, Trade Name Usage |
| **Culpability Type** | Systemic / Operational | Administrative / Technical |
| **Aiding & Abetting?** | Cited for Aiding & Abetting Hills | Not Cited for Aiding & Abetting |
| **Fine Amount** | $50,000.00 | $5,000.00 |
| **Restitution Ordered** | $5,750.00 (to 23 borrowers) | **$0.00** |
| **License Effect** | Compliance Required / Cease & Desist | **NONE** |

## Chapter 5: Corrective Narrative for Professional Records

The automated summaries often conflate "Regulatory Action" with "Wrongdoing." Based on the primary text of the Consent Order, the accurate narrative is as follows:

### Corrected Professional Statement:

> "In 2018, while employed as a loan originator for Seattle Mortgage Brokers, LLC, I resolved an administrative consent order regarding the technical licensing status of my remote work location. The Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) explicitly noted that this action had **'License Effect: None'** and ordered **zero restitution**, confirming no consumer harm. The systemic operational failures of that period—including surety bond lapses and financial reporting errors—were attributed solely to the company owners in a separate order (C-17-2166-18-CO02), for which the company was cited for aiding and abetting the administrative errors."

## Chapter 6: Conclusion

The exhaustive review of the Washington DFI files for Case C-17-2166 validates the assertion: **It was not your fault.**

1. **Scope of Liability:** You were an employee. The owners failed to maintain the surety bond and file federal reports, which were the primary drivers of the enforcement action.

2. **Nature of Infraction:** Your citation for working from an unlicensed location was an administrative technicality resulting from the company's failure to file a Form MU3.

3. **Regulatory Intent:** The regulator's designation of **"License Effect: None"** is the legal equivalent of a "clean bill of health" regarding your fitness to practice.

**The weight of this regulatory action belongs to the architects of the company's failure, not to the employee who was caught in the administrative collapse.**
