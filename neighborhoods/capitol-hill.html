          <h2>Who Capitol Hill often attracts</h2>
          <p>
            Capitol Hill tends to attract buyers who want a dense, urban lifestyle—close to restaurants, nightlife, transit, and cultural events. Many are professionals, creatives, and investors who value walkability and proximity over square footage.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a housing perspective, there’s a notable mix of condos, older buildings with character, and newer developments layered into a tight footprint.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Common borrower questions (from a marketing lens)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>“What’s different about purchasing a condo in Capitol Hill compared to a house in another neighborhood?”</li>
            <li>“What kinds of things should I expect the process to look like with an older building?”</li>
            <li>“How fast do I need to be ready to move when something I like hits the market?”</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted">
            These questions are about expectations and process. Specific, personal guidance on loan options and eligibility belongs with a licensed Movement Mortgage loan officer.

        <div>
          <h2>Where automation can support the experience</h2>
          <p>
            Because Capitol Hill purchases often involve condos or unique properties, communication clarity matters. Automation can help licensed loan officers by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sending clear, pre-written explanations of common condo-related steps in the process</li>
            <li>Sharing educational content when a borrower first expresses interest in Capitol Hill</li>
            <li>Keeping agents and borrowers updated with status check-ins during busy, competitive timelines</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Always route specifics to licensed professionals</h2>
          <p>
            This page is intended as a high-level, process-and-marketing perspective on Capitol Hill. Any questions about specific loan programs, monthly payments, or qualification details should be directed to a licensed Movement Mortgage loan officer.
