          <h2>Who West Seattle often attracts</h2>
          <p>
            West Seattle often appeals to people who want more space, a neighborhood feel, and views or proximity to the water—while still being tied into the broader Seattle area. You see a mix of families, long-term homeowners, and buyers looking for a bit of breathing room.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Typical questions borrowers ask (from a process standpoint)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>“How should I think about timing if I need to sell another home and buy in West Seattle?”</li>
            <li>“What should I expect in terms of process if I’m considering updating or renovating after I buy?”</li>
            <li>“Is there anything different about the overall journey compared to buying closer to downtown?”</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted">
            These are expectation and planning questions. Detailed, personalized recommendations are handled by licensed Movement Mortgage loan officers.

          <h2>How automation can help here</h2>
          <p>
            For a neighborhood that draws many move-up buyers and long-term planners, automation can support licensed loan officers by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Providing structured checklists and reminders for people buying and selling around the same time</li>
            <li>Delivering educational content about typical timelines and steps</li>
            <li>Keeping communication steady when a transaction has more moving parts or longer planning horizons</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Where to send loan-specific questions</h2>
