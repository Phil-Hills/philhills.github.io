        A detailed look at who I am, what I actually do in the mortgage world, and how marketing, automation, and AI all fit together in a support role for licensed Movement Mortgage loan officers.

          <h2>Short version</h2>
          <p>
            I’m <strong>Phil Hills</strong>, a Seattle-based <strong>marketing and AI automation specialist</strong>. I work behind the scenes to support <strong>licensed Movement Mortgage loan officers</strong> with better workflows, clearer communication, and digital experiences that make the mortgage journey easier to follow.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do <strong>not</strong> originate loans, quote rates, or provide mortgage advice. My lane is <strong>marketing, content, automation, and experience design</strong>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>What I actually do day to day</h2>
          <p>
            My work lives at the intersection of technology, communication, and process. In practical terms, that means:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Designing <strong>communication flows</strong> that keep borrowers informed and reduce surprises</li>
            <li>Building <strong>automation workflows</strong> that support licensed loan officers with reminders, follow-ups, and status touchpoints</li>
            <li>Creating <strong>content systems</strong> and templates for borrower education and agent communication</li>
            <li>Using <strong>AI tools</strong> to draft, organize, and structure messages—always under human review</li>
            <li>Developing <strong>Seattle-focused neighborhood and process content</strong> that loan officers can use with their clients</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>How I fit into the mortgage ecosystem</h2>
          <p>
            I support the work that <strong>licensed Movement Mortgage loan officers</strong> do. Think of it as the infrastructure around the conversation: the right message at the right time, in a format that borrowers and partners can easily understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am not part of underwriting, pricing, or loan decisioning. Instead, I collaborate with marketing, sales, and operations stakeholders to improve:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How updates are delivered to borrowers</li>
            <li>How agents stay informed during a file</li>
            <li>How digital experiences reflect what’s really happening in the process</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>What I don’t do (clear boundaries)</h2>
          <p>
            To keep things unambiguous, here are the lines I intentionally do not cross:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>I am <strong>not</strong> a mortgage loan originator.</li>
            <li>I <strong>do not</strong> take loan applications.</li>
            <li>I <strong>do not</strong> quote interest rates, payments, or terms.</li>
            <li>I <strong>do not</strong> provide personalized mortgage recommendations.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted">
            Any questions about loan options, eligibility, numbers, or specific scenarios should always be directed to a licensed Mortgage Loan Originator at Movement Mortgage.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>My background in fintech, automation, and AI</h2>
          <p>
            I’ve spent more than two decades working with technology and automation—building tools, workflows, and conversational systems. Over time, that work shifted toward the mortgage space, where small improvements in communication and process can meaningfully change the way the experience feels for borrowers and partners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some recurring themes in my work:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Automation:</strong> using workflows to handle routine communication and reminders</li>
            <li><strong>Conversation design:</strong> shaping messages so they feel clear and human</li>
            <li><strong>AI assistance:</strong> drafting and organizing content while keeping licensed professionals in control of the message</li>
            <li><strong>Experience design:</strong> thinking about the borrower journey from first contact through closing</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>How I use AI (and where the guardrails are)</h2>
          <p>
            AI is a tool I use to support—not replace—licensed professionals. My approach is simple:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>AI can <strong>draft, summarize, and help structure</strong> communication.</li>
            <li>AI does <strong>not</strong> independently create or confirm loan terms, numbers, or recommendations.</li>
            <li>Final messages, especially anything that touches compliance-sensitive topics, are <strong>reviewed and approved by humans</strong>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted">
            In other words, AI helps with the “how we say it” and “when we send it,” not the “what loan should someone get.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Why Seattle shows up in my work so much</h2>
          <p>
            I’m based in Seattle, and a lot of the educational content and flows I work on are anchored in and around this market. That’s why you’ll see references to places like Ballard, Capitol Hill, and West Seattle across this site.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is to create <strong>neighborhood-aware content</strong> that licensed Movement Mortgage loan officers can draw from when talking with borrowers. It’s not about making recommendations—it’s about giving context and reducing confusion.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Verified places to find me online</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re trying to confirm that you’ve got the right “Phil Hills,” these are the core sources that reflect my professional identity:
