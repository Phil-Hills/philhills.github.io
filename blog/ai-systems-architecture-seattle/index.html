    <h1>AI Systems Architecture in Seattle: My Approach to Multi-Agent Workflows</h1>
    <div class="meta">
      By <a href="/author/phil-hills/">Phil Hills</a> · Based in Magnolia, Seattle, Washington
    </div>

    <p>
      I live in <strong>Magnolia, Seattle</strong>, right across from <strong>Discovery Park</strong>. It’s a quiet
      vantage point over a city that has quietly become one of the nerve centers for cloud infrastructure and AI.
      When I talk about “AI systems architecture,” I’m not talking about a single clever prompt — I’m talking about the
      scaffolding: multi-agent workflows, semantic memory, and protocols that make behavior predictable.
    </p>

    <p>
      This post is a walkthrough of how I think about AI systems architecture from that vantage point in Seattle — as a
      builder, a <strong>dad</strong>, a <strong>U12 girls soccer coach</strong>, and someone who resets every day with
      <strong>hot pilates and yoga at TruFusion Ballard</strong>. The work and the life are intertwined: discipline,
      structure, and iteration show up in both.
    </p>

    <h2>Why “Systems Architecture,” Not Just Prompts</h2>
    <p>
      The easiest thing to build with AI is a single model call with a big prompt. The hardest thing to build is a
      system that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Has <strong>clear responsibilities</strong> for each component</li>
      <li>Preserves <strong>memory</strong> across steps and tasks</li>
      <li>Can be <strong>debugged</strong> and reasoned about</li>
      <li><strong>Survives change</strong> in models, tools, and data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      My work is aimed squarely at the second category. When I say “AI systems architecture,” I mean the design of the
      protocols, memory, and orchestration that sit around models and make them behave like part of a living system.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Ingredients: Memory, Orchestration, Protocols</h2>
    <p>
      In practice, AI systems architecture for me comes down to three pillars:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Semantic memory</strong> – a structured way to store and reuse state.</li>
      <li><strong>Agentic orchestration</strong> – something outside the models that routes work and enforces rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Protocols</strong> – clear, repeatable formats for how agents and tools communicate.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      On this site, you’ll see those ideas show up as things like
      <a href="/cube-protocol.html">Cube Protocol</a> and the orchestration work referenced on the
      <a href="/projects.html">Projects</a> and <a href="/code.html">Code</a> pages. Under the hood, I’m trying to
      build an ecosystem where agents don’t just talk — they exchange well-formed packets that can be inspected
      and replayed.
    </p>

    <h2>Multi-Agent Workflows: The Controller Outside the Model</h2>
    <p>
      Real multi-agent systems are not just a single model pretending to be different roles. They have:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A supervising <strong>controller</strong> (the orchestrator)</li>
      <li><strong>Capability-scoped agents</strong> with clear responsibilities</li>
      <li>A shared <strong>memory substrate</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Execution rules</strong> — timeouts, retries, and permissions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      My controller layer is the part that lives outside any one model. It decides:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Which agent should handle this step?</li>
      <li>What memory should they see?</li>
      <li>What format should their output follow?</li>
      <li>What happens if they fail or return an invalid packet?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      That logic is grounded in the same thinking I apply when I’m coaching a U12 girls team: every player has a role,
      the field has structure, and we run patterns — not random chaos — even if each game is different.
    </p>

    <h2>Semantic Memory from Seattle: Why Context Has to Persist</h2>
    <p>
      Living near Discovery Park, it’s impossible not to think in terms of context and landscape. The model’s context
      window is a narrow viewpoint; the system’s memory is the full map. If you want agents to do meaningful work,
      they need access to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What has already happened</li>
      <li>What decisions were made and why</li>
      <li>Which data was used and how it was structured</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      That’s why I work on semantic memory systems like Cube Protocol: to create <strong>reversible, structured
      memory packets</strong> that can be stored, inspected, and reused. It’s not enough for a model to “remember”
      in some fuzzy sense — the system needs a durable, testable representation of what happened.
    </p>

    <h2>Protocol-First Design</h2>
    <p>
      Protocols are the quiet backbone of any robust system. For AI, that means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Standardized <strong>packet formats</strong> for requests and responses</li>
      <li>Clear <strong>schemas</strong> for memory entries</li>
      <li>Consistent <strong>interfaces</strong> between agents and tools</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The work I do in my
      <a href="https://github.com/Phil-Hills" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub repositories</a>
      is often about exploring new protocol shapes: how can we encode this state so it’s cheap to store, easy to
      reconstruct, and self-explanatory to another agent or system?
    </p>

    <h2>Life Rhythms That Keep Systems Work Sane</h2>
    <p>
      The way I approach systems is heavily influenced by my routines in Seattle. Coaching soccer forces me to think in
      terms of roles, structure, and long-term development rather than short-term wins. Living across from
      <strong>Discovery Park</strong> means regular walks and resets that keep my thinking clear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Daily training at <strong>TruFusion Ballard</strong> — especially hot pilates and yoga — reinforces discipline and
      pacing. You can’t rush adaptation, whether it’s a system, a team, or your own body. That mindset shows up in how
      I design AI architectures: small changes, consistent habits, and clear feedback loops over time.
    </p>

    <h2>How This All Shows Up in Code</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to see this philosophy in practice, the best place to look is my code:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/code.html">Code overview on this site</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Phil-Hills" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">github.com/Phil-Hills</a></li>
      <li><a href="/cube-protocol.html">Cube Protocol docs</a></li>
      <li><a href="/projects.html">Projects page</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Those repositories are not just demos — they’re how I test system ideas: new memory formats, orchestration
      patterns, and ways to make AI behavior more structured, reversible, and trustworthy.
    </p>

    <h2>Closing: AI Systems Architecture From Magnolia, Seattle</h2>
    <p>
      When you search for <strong>“Phil Hills Seattle”</strong>, what you’re really looking for is a picture of who I am
      now: an AI Systems Architect in Magnolia, building protocol-driven AI systems, raising a family across from
      Discovery Park, coaching youth soccer, and training most days at TruFusion Ballard.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mix of work, family, community, and routine is what shapes my approach to AI systems architecture. The code
      and protocols are one expression of that — the rest is lived here in Seattle.
