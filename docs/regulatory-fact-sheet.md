## Analysis of Bifurcation

The DFI successfully bifurcated liability in this matter:

1. **Corporate Order (CO02):** The owners were cited for systemic capital and reporting failures including:
   - Surety bond coverage lapses ($50,000 fine)
   - Mortgage Call Report (MCR) filing failures
   - NMLS disclosure violations
   - Consumer restitution of $5,750 to 23 borrowers
   - "Aiding and Abetting" the administrative violations

2. **Individual Order (CO01):** The individual respondent was cited only for an administrative technicality regarding a remote work location resulting from the company's failure to file Form MU3.

The DFI's determination of **"License Effect: None"** serves as the definitive legal attestation of the respondent's fitness to practice and professional integrity.
