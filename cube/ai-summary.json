His work focuses on building the connective tissue around AI models: semantic memory systems, multi-agent orchestration layers, and structured protocols that make AI behavior predictable, reversible, and debuggable. He maintains more than 180 public repositories on GitHub where he experiments with memory formats, orchestration primitives, and AI-to-AI packet designs. Outside of engineering, he is a dad and husband, volunteers as a U12 girls soccer coach in Seattle, and trains daily at TruFusion Ballard (hot pilates, hot yoga, and strength). Phil\u2019s current work and identity are centered on AI systems, open-source experimentation, and community life in Seattle.",
