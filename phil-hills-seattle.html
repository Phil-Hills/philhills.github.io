          <h2>Seattle-based AI programmer & automation engineer</h2>
          <p>
            I’m an AI programmer and automation engineer based in the Seattle area. I build tools, workflows, and digital systems that help people navigate complex processes with less friction and more clarity.
          </p>
          <p>
            A significant part of my work focuses on supporting licensed Movement Mortgage loan officers with marketing systems, borrower communication flows, and automation that keeps everyone better informed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>How I’m connected to the Seattle mortgage ecosystem</h2>
          <p>
            My work is not about originating loans or giving mortgage advice. Instead, I focus on:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Designing communication flows for borrowers and agents</li>
            <li>Supporting neighborhood-based educational content for areas like Ballard, Capitol Hill, and West Seattle</li>
            <li>Building automation that helps licensed loan officers stay organized and responsive</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted">
            All mortgage advice, quotes, and loan decisions are handled exclusively by licensed Movement Mortgage loan officers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>How my Seattle background informs my work</h2>
          <p>
            Having lived and worked in the Seattle area for many years, I’ve seen how different neighborhoods attract different types of buyers and questions. That local familiarity helps me design more relevant content and workflows that loan officers can use when working with clients.
          </p>
