# 👋 Hi, I’m Phil Hills

**AI & Robotics Systems Architect & Agentic Protocol Engineer — Magnolia, Seattle, WA**

I build the connective tissue around AI models: semantic memory systems, multi-agent orchestration layers, and structured protocols that make model behavior predictable, debuggable, and reusable.

I live in **Magnolia, Seattle**, right across from **Discovery Park**, and I maintain **180+ public repositories** exploring these ideas in code.

## 🧩 What I Work On

- **Semantic Memory Systems**  
  Reversible, structured memory formats (like [Cube Protocol](https://philhills.com/cube-protocol.html)) so agents can carry state between steps, tools, and workflows.

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**  
  Controllers and workflows that supervise specialized agents, decide who does what, and enforce timeouts, retries, and permissions.

- **Protocol-First AI Design**  
  AI-to-AI packet formats and schemas that make behavior explicit instead of relying on vague prompts.

- **Large-Scale Data Workflows**  
  Compression, transformation, and semantic labeling for complex datasets across multiple domains.

Most of the code here is me trying these ideas in public before they become stable systems or formal protocols.

## 🧠 Background

I bring **20+ years** of experience across automation, software development, and AI systems.

Today, my focus is:

- Designing **semantic memory systems** and **multi-agent architectures**
- Building **protocols and packet formats** for AI-to-AI communication
- Running **open-source experiments** to test ideas before they become production patterns

If you’re interested in **AI systems architecture, semantic memory, or agentic workflows**, feel free to connect or open an issue in any repo.

## 🌲 Life in Seattle

Outside of code:

- I’m a **dad** and **husband** living in **Magnolia**, spending a lot of time in and around **Discovery Park**.  
- I volunteer as a **U12 girls soccer coach** here in Seattle.  
- I train daily at **TruFusion Ballard** (hot pilates, hot yoga, and strength), which keeps me disciplined and grounded.

Those rhythms — family, coaching, training — shape how I think about systems: long-term, structured, and focused on steady improvement rather than quick wins.

Thanks for stopping by. If you’ve got something interesting in AI systems, memory, or orchestration, I’m always open to a conversation.
